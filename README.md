This repo is no longer publicly supported.

# Basic Usage

Include the script.

```html
<script src="/path/to/shutterstock-oauth.js"></script>
```

Build the oauth object

```javascript
  //build the oauth object
  var options = {
    client_id: "0FF2460C9DD14F449FD5EDF780121F9B",
    scope: "user.email",
    redirect_endpoint: "done.html"
  };
  var oauth = new ShutterstockOAuth(options);
```

Bind the authorize method to a click event

```javascript
  $("#auth_button").on("click", oauth.authorize);
```

# Example

Inside the example folder there is a file index.html. You will need to change `INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` to your client id. For the redirect flow to work, the example will need to be running in a web server. The easiest way to do this is run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the root of the project. Then open [http://localhost:8000/example/index.html](http://localhost:8000/example/index.html).

The authorize button will open an authorize pop-up. Below the button, there is a log of the data sent to the callbacks.

# Options

##### client_id *(required)*

The client_id for the authorized client.


##### scope *(required)*

A string of all requested grant scopes separated by spaces


##### redirect_endpoint *(required)*

The `redirect_endpoint` is relative path from the current domain that the oauth service will redirect to after the authorization is complete.

##### realm *(optional)*

The Shutterstock domain where access will be requested.

Default: `customer`

Possible Values:

* `customer`:    "shutterstock.com"
* `offset`:      "offset.com"
* `contributor`: "contributor-accounts.shutterstock.com"

##### site *(optional)*

If the `customer` realm is used, you can specify the site.

Possible Values:

* `premier`:    For users of "premier.shutterstock.com"

##### success *(optional)*

A function that will be called when the authorization process is successfully completed.

```javascript
function (data) {
  // data is a hash of the result
};
```

For successful calls, that data object will only have one field: `code`

```javascript
var sampleSuccessData = { code: "xSw2EH5sylIgkZ7Jdp" }
```


##### failure *(optional)*

Callback called when the authorization process fails for any reason.

```javascript
function (data) {
  // data is a hash of the result
};
```
The data object for failures will have three properties:

* `error`:  The type of failure. Most-likely "access_denied"
* `error_reason`: The reason why the authorization failed.
* `error_description`: A human readable version of the error reason.

Example:

```javascript
{
  error: "access_denied",
  error_description: "The popup was closed before authorization was completed.",
  error_reason: "user_denied"
}
```

##### completed *(optional)*

Callback called when the authorization process is completed.

```javascript
function (data) {
  //data is a hash of the result
};
```

The data passed to the `completed` callback is the same that would be passed to the `success` and the `failure` callbacks.
